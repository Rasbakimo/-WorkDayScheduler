# -WorkDayScheduler
for this task, I started off by looking at what was given. 
Then, I thought about ways I could use the id's and classes from css that werent in the html file.
I thought about variables and functions I could create. 
Then I went to get an API to use and chose one after reading the documentation.
I copied the tremendously long API doc and put it on a seperate script file and linked it to my html.
At that point I could complete the rest of the task with js and jquery.
After using google to understand some things in jquery like functionality and syntax, I was able to get the project operational.
